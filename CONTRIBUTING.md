## üìú Contribution Walkthrough

### ‚Üí Adding a New Event

If you want to add a new event, go to the **`content/events/` folder**.

Each event is documented in a markdown file for each one. So, to create one:

2. Create a new **markdown file** with a descriptive name (e.g., `2025-05-20-your-event-name.md` )
3. Use the **following template** to add the event details:

```markdown
---
title: 'Your Event Title'
metaTitle: 'Your Event Title'
metaDesc: 'A brief description of your event'
date: 'MM/DD'
UTCStartTime: 'HH:MM'
UTCEndTime: 'HH:MM'
type: 'meetup'
language: 'English'
location: 'Virtual or Physical Location'
userName: 'organizationName'
userLink: 'https://link-to-organization.com'
linkUrl: 'https://link-to-event.com'
---

Detailed description of your event goes here. You can use markdown formatting.
```

After these fields, on the line following `---`, **add the event description** in markdown format, then submit a **PR** with your changes.

### ‚Üí Adding a New Resource

If you want to add a new resource (podcasts, articles, video, etc.) to the Library page (where links can be added and edited), you should:

1. Open the **`content/library/resources.json` file**
2. Add a new entry to the `resources` array following this **format** below:

```json
{
  "title": "Resource Title",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "description": "Brief description (max 200 characters)",
  "link": "https://link-to-resource.com",
  "type": "video|article|tutorial|etc",
  "topics": "relevant topic tags"
}
```

3. Submit a **PR** with your changes

### ‚Üí Fixing Typos or Content Issues

Found a grammatical mistake? A broken link? Or even something more technical, like outdated information? Firstly, you should:

1. **Locate the file** with the content that needs correction

   - **Website text** is in the `content/` directory
   - For **events**, check `content/events/`
   - For **library resources**, check `content/library/resources.json`
   - For **homepage sections**, `content/home/`
   - **Common website text** (menu, footer, page titles, etc.) `content/commons.json`

2. Make your corrections
3. Submit a **PR** describing what you fixed

### ‚Üí Making Code Changes

If you believe there's a **feature or functionality that could be improved** or even a **better way to perform a certain task**, here's what you should do:

1. For **structural** code changes, please **open an issue first to discuss your proposal**
2. Follow the **project's coding style** and patterns
