### ‚Üí Adding a New Event

If you want to add a new event, go to the **`content/events/` folder**.

Each event is documented in a markdown file for each one. So, to create one:

2. Create a new **markdown file** with a descriptive name (e.g., `2025-05-20-your-event-name.md` )
3. Use the **following template** to add the event details:

```
---
title: 'GitHub Virtual Meetup: Africa'
metaTitle: 'GitHub Virtual Meetup: Africa'
metaDesc: 'Join GitHub users across Africa to talk about open source project maintainership!'
date: '06/16'
UTCStartTime: '12:00'
UTCEndTime: '15:00'
type: 'meetup'
userName: 'github'
userLink: 'https://www.meetup.com/GitHub-Africa/'
linkTitle: 'Join the GitHub Africa meetup'
linkUrl: 'https://www.meetup.com/GitHub-Africa/'
---

Join GitHub users across Africa to talk about open source project maintainership!

Speakers TBD, follow along on the Meetup page for announcements.
```

üìå All fields included in the _frontmatter_ are **mandator**y:

- `title`: event title.
- `metaTitle`: title to use as meta tag.
- `metaDesc`: description to use as meta tag.
- `date`: date of event, in `MM/DD` format.
- `UTCStartTime`: start time in UTC, in `HH:MM` format.
- `UTCStartTime`: end time in UTC, in `HH:MM` format.
- `type`: one of the following `podcast`, `stream`, `talk`, `meetup`, `fundraising`, `conference`, `misc`.
- `userName`: user name or organization organizing the event.
- `userLink`: link to user or organization profile.
- `linkTitle`: button text with external link to the event.
- `linkUrl`: Button link with external link to the event.

After these fields, on the line following `---`, **add the event description** in markdown format, then submit a **PR** with your changes.

### ‚Üí Adding a New Resource

If you want to add a new resource (podcasts, articles, video, etc.) to the Library page (where links can be added and edited), you should:

1. Open the **`content/library/resources.json` file**
2. Add a new entry to the `resources` array following this **format** below:

```json
{
  "title": "Resource Title",
  "author": "Author Name",
  "description": "Brief description (max 200 characters)",
  "link": "https://link-to-resource.com",
  "type": "video|article|tutorial|etc",
  "topics": "relevant topic tags"
}
```

3. Submit a **PR** with your changes

### ‚Üí Fixing Typos or Content Issues

Found a grammatical mistake? A broken link? Or even something more technical, like outdated information? Firstly, you should:

   - For **library resources**, check `content/library/resources.json`
   - For **homepage sections**, `content/home/`

2. Make your corrections
3. Submit a **PR** describing what you fixed

### ‚Üí Making Code Changes
