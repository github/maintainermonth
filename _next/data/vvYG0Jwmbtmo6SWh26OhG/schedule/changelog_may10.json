Open source runs the world, but who runs open source? Maintainers. Open source maintainers are behind the software we use everyday, but they don’t always have the community or support they need. That’s why we’re celebrating open source maintainers during the month of May. Today’s conversation features Alyssa Wright (Bloomberg), Chad Whitacre (Sentry), and Duane O’Brien (Creator of the FOSS Contributor Fund and framework). We get into all the details, the why, the hows, and the struggles involved for companies to support open source.","link":"/schedule/changelog_may10"},"ogImage":"https://maintainermonth.github.com/images/og/event-42a6b19bc9783c0cad899cfc29740cdf.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
