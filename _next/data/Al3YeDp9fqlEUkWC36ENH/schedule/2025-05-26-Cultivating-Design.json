On May 26 at 18:00, join us at Cultivation Space in Berlin for the return of the Cultivating Design Meetup, this time in the context of Open Source Maintainer Month. Maintainers carry a huge load—coordination, communication, burnout—and design often gets left out of the support structure. It shouldn’t.\n\nWe’ll hear from Felix Reda, Director at GitHub, who’s been thinking deeply about what it means to maintain not just code, but entire ecosystems. Expect real talk, not recycled slides—about what design can actually do in open source (and what it often fails to do).\n\nOrganized by Ura Design and supported by GitHub, this isn’t a formal panel or a pitch deck showcase. It’s an honest space for designers and maintainers to compare notes, swap challenges, and get a better sense of where design fits in the long game of open source. Bring your questions. Bring your skepticism. We’ll bring snacks.\n","link":"/schedule/2025-05-26-Cultivating-Design"},"ogImage":"https://maintainermonth.github.com/images/og/event-ec97bf7bd84253ab807774a2ed7093e8.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
