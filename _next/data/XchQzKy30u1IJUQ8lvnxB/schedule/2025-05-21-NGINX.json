Please join enthusiasts from the NGINX, Workday, and local Dublin communities for an evening of knowledge sharing and connection.\n\nWe will have pizza and drinks upon arrival, so come hungry and thirsty!\n\n**Talk 1 - Information Architecture in Our Everyday Lives by Alan Dooley**\nInformation architecture informs all the content we consume. Like good design, we don't notice it unless it's gone wrong. This talk is an introduction on what information architecture is, what it means in personal and professional contexts, and how we can use it to manage our information better.\n\n**Talk 2 - The Subtle Art of Lying with Statistics by Dave McAllister**\n\"Lies, damned lies and statistics.\"But statistics allow you to lie to yourself. Statistics can trick us into believing things that are less than true, though not on purpose. Learn how data choice, event focus and scale change perspective. See how graphs mislead and correlation can cause confusion. Join in for a light-hearted view of the world of statistical manipulation\n\n**Talk 3 & 4: Could be from you!**\nIn addition to speakers from NGINX, a Call for Papers (CFP) is open to other local enthusiasts. We'd love to support community submissions. Proposals should be topics of interest to open source technologists and not product pitches.\nCFP due date: Thursday, 14th May\n\nIf you have any questions about NGINX, whether that's troubleshooting your config or simply wanting to learn more, we'll have resources available to help you out.\n","link":"/schedule/2025-05-21-NGINX"},"ogImage":"https://maintainermonth.github.com/images/og/event-54bd7b709b1ca491f1c7d8a50e1a6551.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
