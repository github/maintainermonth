Like good design, we don't notice it unless it's gone wrong. This talk is an introduction on what information architecture is, what it means in personal and professional contexts, and how we can use it to manage our information better.\n\n**Talk 2 - The Subtle Art of Lying with Statistics by Dave McAllister**\n\"Lies, damned lies and statistics.\"But statistics allow you to lie to yourself. Statistics can trick us into believing things that are less than true, though not on purpose. Learn how data choice, event focus and scale change perspective. See how graphs mislead and correlation can cause confusion. Join in for a light-hearted view of the world of statistical manipulation\n\n**Talk 3 & 4: Could be from you!**\nIn addition to speakers from NGINX, a Call for Papers (CFP) is open to other local enthusiasts. We'd love to support community submissions. Proposals should be topics of interest to open source technologists and not product pitches.\nCFP due date: Thursday, 14th May\n\nIf you have any questions about NGINX, whether that's troubleshooting your config or simply wanting to learn more, we'll have resources available to help you out.\n","link":"/schedule/2025-05-21-NGINX"},{"formattedDate":{"date":"May 21","startTime":{"utc":"15:30 pm","pt":"08:30 am"},"endTime":{"utc":"16:30 pm","pt":"09:30 am"},"endDate":null},"slug":"2025-05-21-OSI","title":"Open Source Initiative Town Hall","metaTitle":"Open Source Initiative Town Hall for maintainers","metaDesc":"The OSI will host a Town Hall during Maintainer Month on discuss how we can support maintainers, foster secure development practices, and share resources.","date":"05/21","UTCStartTime":"15:30","UTCEndTime":"16:30","type":"stream","language":"English","userName":"Open Source Initiative","userLink":"https://opensource.org/events/osi-maintainer-month","linkUrl":"https://opensource.org/events/osi-maintainer-month","location":"Virtual","content":"\nThroughout the month, Open Source Initiative (OSI) and affiliates will be highlighting maintainers who prioritize security in their projects, sharing their stories, and providing a platform for collaboration and learning.\n\nAs part of the programming for May, OSI will host a virtual Town Hall alongside affiliate organizations and invite the broader Open Source community to join.

Maintainers carry a huge load—coordination, communication, burnout—and design often gets left out of the support structure. It shouldn’t.\n\nWe’ll hear from Felix Reda, Director at GitHub, who’s been thinking deeply about what it means to maintain not just code, but entire ecosystems. Expect real talk, not recycled slides—about what design can actually do in open source (and what it often fails to do).\n\nOrganized by Ura Design and supported by GitHub, this isn’t a formal panel or a pitch deck showcase. It’s an honest space for designers and maintainers to compare notes, swap challenges, and get a better sense of where design fits in the long game of open source. Bring your questions. Bring your skepticism.
