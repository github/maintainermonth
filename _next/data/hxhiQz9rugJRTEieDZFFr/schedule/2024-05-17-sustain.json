Carlotta shares her journey from an undergraduate student rarely seeing diversity in her field to becoming an engineering professor determined to change that narrative. She discusses her work at the Children's Museum of Indianapolis. She also dives into her motivations behind founding two nonprofits, Black in Engineering and Black in Robotics. Additionally, Carlotta touches upon her engagement with open source communities, particularly in robotics, to further democratize STEM education. The discussion also covers her unique approaches to connecting with younger audiences through hip hop slam poetry on TikTok and the significance of representation in every aspect of STEM, from academia to community initiatives.\n","link":"/schedule/2024-05-17-sustain"},"ogImage":"https://maintainermonth.github.com/images/og/event-9a49be47a3ec67b7d839c2b1511ad249.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
