He has been doing Open Source for 20+ years and has the scars to prove it. After all these years he can't quite shake the intuition that Open Source is a gift that's even greater than we realize ... and that truly accepting it could heal the world. After launching the [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/), he now has the daunting task of growing the Pledge into a meaningful movement that truly changes the status quo for Open Source maintainers. To do that, he'll have to bring the vision to a lot more people. What better way than a new YouTube show?
