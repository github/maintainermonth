But who runs open source? Who is there, day by day, to keeping it all running? Open Source project maintainers make the software we use possible. But project maintenance is intense work - and it doesn’t happen in a vacuum.\n\nMaintainer Month is a reminder for the ecosystem to support, celebrate, and compensate open source maintainers.\n\nMaintainer Month is an opportunity for maintainers to gather and share knowledge and experiences. It’s a time to see how other projects are tackling similar problems. And it’s a time to reflect collectively that the challenges faced aren’t all technical, and the burden on maintainers can come with a lack of boundaries, vacations, or emotional support. Whether you’re celebrating contributions to open source, or reflecting on the particular pains of this line of labor, this is a month to come together.\n"},"getInvolved":{"anchorNavSection":"Get involved","title":"What’s going on during Maintainer Month?","examplesTitle":"How do I get involved?","examples":[{"title":"Posting on social media to thank the maintainers of their favorite open source projects","image":"/images/thanks.png"},{"title":"Recording special podcast episodes","image":"/images/podcast.png"},{"title":"Organizing special-edition open working group meetings","image":"/images/meetings.png"},{"title":"Hosting mini-events","image":"/images/events.png"},{"title":"Convening tool-specific maintainer summits","image":"/images/tools.png"},{"title":"Streaming live on Twitch","image":"/images/twitch.png"},{"title":"Pledging to donate to support Open Source","image":"/images/donate.png"}],"content":"\nThis is an open source initiative to bookmark a month to collectively contemplate open source maintainership, whatever form that takes.
