Sharing software is an act of hope and generosity. As a maintainer, what sparks the fire of your joy for open source? If your fire is burning low, how do you find your way back to what sparked joy about open source? Last year we focused on burnout, a serious issue maintainers frequently face. This year, we’re talking about the flip side: the energizing aspects of open source.","theme2":"Maintainers keep the software ecosystem running, but they’re humans, not machines. Do you know who the maintainers you rely on are? Do you know what kind of support those individuals actually need? Ask what you can do for them, and be ready to listen.","content":"\nOpen source runs the world, but who runs open source? Open source maintainers are behind the software we use everyday, but they don't always have the community or support they need.
