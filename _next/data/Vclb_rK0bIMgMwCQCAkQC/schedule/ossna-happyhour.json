You’re invited to the Maintainer Month Happy Hour hosted by GitHub on Tuesday night.\n\nOpen source runs the world, but who runs open source? Open source maintainers are behind the software we use everyday, but they don't always have the community or support they need. That's why we're celebrating open source maintainers during the month of May.\n\nAs a thank you for the great work you’re doing for the open source community, please enjoy some appetizers and have a drink on us. Bring your friends, connect with peers, and chat with GitHub on how we can best support the community.\n\nYou must be registered for Open Source Summit North America to attend this happy hour. Use the Maintainer Month discount code OSSNA23GHMM for a 20% discount for new registrants!","link":"/schedule/ossna-happyhour"},"ogImage":"https://maintainermonth.github.com/images/og/event-b232d18a483b0403d64aa1a4f48cac85.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
