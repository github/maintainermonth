On this episode, Richard is interviewing a few open source maintainers to talk about what itâ€™s like to be a maintainer, how awesome they are, and what issues they may have being a maintainer. My first guest is Mike McQuaid, who works for GitHub and is one of the maintainers of Homebrew. Mike tells us all about Homebrew, how you can contribute, and the most fun thing about being a maintainer there. Also joining me is Nina Breznik, another awesome maintainer, Founder of RefugeesWork, Partner and Open Source Developer at Playproject, Community Organizer at Wizard Amigos, and she works on a DatDot project with serapath. Nina shares how it is for her being a maintainer, how she helps other people see it as art, not just science and math, but a more creative thing, and she tells us the project she had the most fun working on.","link":"/2022/schedule/sustainjun24"},"ogImage":"https://maintainermonth.github.com/images/og/event-b1b8a4e0e493ab4c658da5e148dbe3ea.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
