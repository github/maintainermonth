This workshop will introduce a basic framework for thinking about governance and will dive into some of the most common \"governance bugs\" open source projects face, including cultivating leaders from the community, collective technical decision-making, and formalizing and/or transitioning a governance structure.\n\nWorkshop registration is available in the private Maintainer Community. Request an invitation here: [maintainers.github.com](https://maintainers.github.com)\n\nIf you're part of the private Maintainer Community, you can [register here](https://github.com/community/maintainers/discussions/328).\n","link":"/schedule/open-source-governance"},"ogImage":"https://maintainermonth.github.com/images/og/event-fd3561cc1d9237abd80c14ad071fe368.png"},"__N_SSG":true}
