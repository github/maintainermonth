Sharing software is an act of hope and generosity. As a maintainer, what sparks the fire of your joy for open source? If your fire is burning low, how do you find your way back to what sparked joy about open source? Last year we focused on burnout, a serious issue maintainers frequently face. This year, we’re talking about the flip side: the energizing aspects of open source.","theme2":"Maintainers keep the software ecosystem running, but they’re humans, not machines. Do you know who the maintainers you rely on are? Do you know what kind of support those individuals actually need? Ask what you can do for them, and be ready to listen.","content":"\nOpen source runs the world, but who runs open source? Open source maintainers are behind the software we use everyday, but they don't always have the community or support they need. That's why we're celebrating open source maintainers during the month of May.\n"},"getInvolved":{"anchorNavSection":"Get involved","title":"What’s going on during Maintainer Month?","examplesTitle":"How do I get involved?","examples":[{"title":"Posting on social media to thank the maintainers of their favorite open source projects","image":"/images/thanks.png","imageDescription":"Illustration by Ariel Davis of a person thanking an open source maintainer on social media"},{"title":"Recording special podcast episodes","image":"/images/podcast.png","imageDescription":"Illustration by Ariel Davis of a person recording a podcast episode about open source maintainers"},{"title":"Organizing special-edition open working group meetings","image":"/images/meetings.png","imageDescription":"Illustration by Ariel Davis of people at an open working group meeting for open source maintainers"},{"title":"Hosting mini-events","image":"/images/events.png","imageDescription":"Illustration by Ariel Davis of people hosting a mini-event for open source maintainers"},{"title":"Convening tool-specific maintainer summits","image":"/images/tools.png","imageDescription":"Illustration by Ariel Davis of people at a tool-specific maintainer summit for open source projects"},{"title":"Streaming live on Twitch","image":"/images/twitch.png","imageDescription":"Illustration by Ariel Davis of a person streaming on Twitch about open source maintainers"},{"title":"Pledging to donate to support Open Source","image":"/images/donate.png","imageDescription":"Illustration by Ariel Davis of a donation being made to support open source"}],"maintainersTitle":"Calling maintainers!","partnersTitle":"Interested in Partnering?","content":"\nMaintainer Month is an open source project — anyone can jump in and contribute!
