The OSPO Alliance OnRamp meeting series provides an open, neutral and friendly forum, low-threshold entry point to exchange and learn about the basics of how to set up an Open Source Program Office and get started with open source.

In the May session, Gijs will go through decades of Open Source in the European Commission. They may even have had an OSPO even before the term OSPO was coined. A lot of lessons to learn from experienced practitionners. It is an online event open to all with no registration in a safe environment. Just come and grab a seat.
