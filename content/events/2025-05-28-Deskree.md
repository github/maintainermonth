Join us for Open Source Social: Celebrating Maintainers in Toronto, a community-driven event dedicated to helping open source projects grow.

As part of GitHub Maintainer Month, this evening brings together maintainers, contributors, and supporters to share insights, swap stories, and connect in a relaxed setting. Whether you're maintaining, contributing, or just curious, come be part of the conversation.
