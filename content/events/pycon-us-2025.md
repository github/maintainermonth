At PyCon US 2025, you will find an amazing program filled with pre-conference tutorials and sponsor presentations, 90+ of our community's best talks, which includes our Charlas track, brilliant keynote speakers, posters on display, a lively Expo Hall filled with our incredible Sponsors' booths, and our famed lightning talks on each main conference day.

Following the conference days, there are 4 days of sprints that are free to all attendees and offer an opportunity for anyone to collaborate and contribute to a project even if it is their first time.

PyCon US offers a whole host of events such as the Job Fair, Summits, Open Spaces, and PyLadies Auction, and don't forget about the 'hallway' track, which brings together Python users from around the world.
