## Maintainer Month Origins

Maintainer Month was created, and is maintained, by GitHub, starting in 2021 as Maintainer Week. It was simultaneously conceived of by Kara Sowles and Robin Riley, who called each other to tell each other the same idea. It's intended as an industry-wide event that isn't owned by GitHub - that belongs to anyone who wants to contribute or participate. In includes an Advisory Council from folks across the industry that shape what it is.
